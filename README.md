# Code-Refractor-Assignment
<h1>Description</h1>

The purpose of this project was to help our client, Horiseon, establish a website that was more accessible to all users. It is important to note I did not build this website from the ground-up; however, we used Horiseon's current structure to modify the web page. Upon reviewing its current structure, we were able to polish their html and css code as well by making sure the semantic elements found in the css sheet were organized by semantic elements found in the html file. I found one nav link that was not functioning properly. After adding an id tag in the newly dubbed class "successful-tools", I was able to resolve the matter. I also implemented alt tags into img elements found on the html, which will display text if images do not properly load. Lastly, I was able to consolidate the css stylesheet to omit redundant class elements. All changes render the code easier to interpret for subsequent coders and enhance the experience of Horiseon's potential customers.
